# Trials Treasure Hunt Website

This repo contains the code for a website to show a list of tasks for a unicycle treasure hunt.

The tasks are in `tasks.yaml`.
Install `requirements.txt` then run `build.py`. This reads `tasks.yaml`, and then uses Jinja template `template.html.jinja` to produce `index.html`.
`images` contain assets.
